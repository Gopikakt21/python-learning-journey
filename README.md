# Python Learning Journey

A growing collection of Python programs that I create while learning and practicing core programming concepts.  
This repository documents my progress as I explore Python through small exercises, logic-building problems, and mini scripts.

## 📌 About This Repository
- Contains simple, standalone Python programs  
- Each script focuses on one concept or problem  
- Helps strengthen logic, syntax, and problem-solving  
- The repository will continue to expand as I learn more  

## 🎯 Goal
To practice Python regularly and develop a strong foundation in programming through hands-on exercises.
